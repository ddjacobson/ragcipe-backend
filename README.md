#### An intuitive way to chat with your recipes!
Meet Ragcipe, your new cuiliary companion!
Ragcipe is able to query a ground-truth knowledge base of .json files downloaded from Tandoor. 
We are working on further integration with the Tandoor API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

### üìö Knowledge Base Manager
  The kb-manager updates the FAISS on-disk vector store based on the state of the file knowledge base.
  

### üß† RAG Engine
  The RAG Engine has the following duties
  - Initialize the LLM
  - Query the knowledge base
  - Reload (update) the LLM's vector store by interacting with the Knowledge Base Manager
  - Build the RAG chain based on the currently loaded vector store.

## Run the App!
To run the application, clone the repository and use `docker compose up -d` to run the backend and frontend services. By default, the app is reachable at localhost:3000. 
The purpose of this tool is to ingest and interface your data from Tandoor (https://docs.tandoor.dev/). 

The specifics of the ingestion pipline are not yet developed, will be coming soon!
