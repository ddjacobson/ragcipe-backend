I use avocado oil spray.\n\nSprinkle some of the seasoning blend on each chicken breast, and use hands to pat and help the seasoning stick.\n\nPlace the chicken breast, seasoned side down, in the air fryer.\n\nSpray the bare side, which is now facing up, and sprinkle on the remaining seasoning.\n\nCook for 10 minutes on 360 degrees.\n\nFlip over (tongs are extremely helpful), and cook until internal temperature reaches at least 165, about another 8 to 12 minutes on 360 depending on the size of your chicken breasts. (Mine were about 7.75 ounces each, and 10 minutes on the 2nd side was perfect.That's 20 minutes total. See cook time notes section below.)\n\nRemove the basket from the air fryer, and allow the chicken to rest for about 5 minutes before cutting into it. This lets the juices redistribute and helps the chicken be juicier.\n\n### Notes \nRecommended Cook Times: I conducted many tests related to chicken breast size and time cooked. Here is what worked well in my air fryer. For each test, I flip the chicken breast half-way through.\n\n5.5 to 6 ounces 18 minutes \n\n6.5 to 7.5 ounces 19 minutes \n\n7.75 to 8.5 ounces 20 minutes\n\n9 to 10 ounces 21 minutes\n\nNote: Air fryers and cook times may vary from the above. Always use common sense, and make sure your chicken is cooked all the way through.\n\nTimer: use an accurate timer such as a digital timer, like the timer on your phone or microwave. My air fryer has a knob timer, and it is difficult to get an accurate timing. Since the air fryer cooks so fast, this could affect the quality of your chicken breasts.\n\nNote: I rarely measure my seasonings anymore  because I have gotten a good feel for \"enough.\" I did measure everything out for y'all. If it tastes bland, add more salt to taste.\n\nDo not overcrowd the cooking basket. I would recommend cooking no more than 3 or 4 chicken breasts at a time, depending on size.\n\n### Nutritional Information \nCalories 163 kcal\nCholesterol 90mg\nSodium 454mg\nPotassium 522mg\nProtein 30g\nCalcium 11mg\nIron 0.6mg\n\n### Source \nApinchofhealthy.com \nhttps://www.apinchofhealthy.com/air-fryer-chicken-breast/","ingredients":[{"food":{"name":"cooking spray","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":{"name":"Tablespoon","plural_name":null,"description":null},"amount":4.0,"note":"or rub on oil of choice - use about 1/ per chicken breast","order":0,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false},{"food":{"name":"skinless chicken breasts raw","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":{"name":"boneless","plural_name":null,"description":null},"amount":4.0,"note":"mine were about 7.5 to 8 ounces each","order":1,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false},{"food":{"name":"garlic powder","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":{"name":"teaspoon","plural_name":null,"description":null},"amount":0.5,"note":"about 1/8 tsp per chicken breast","order":2,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false},{"food":{"name":"salt","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":{"name":"teaspoon","plural_name":null,"description":null},"amount":0.5,"note":"1/8 tsp per chicken breast","order":3,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false},{"food":{"name":"black pepper","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":{"name":"teaspoon","plural_name":null,"description":null},"amount":0.12,"note":"a dash per chicken breast","order":4,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false},{"food":{"name":"dried oregano","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":{"name":"teaspoon","plural_name":null,"description":null},"amount":0.5,"note":"around 1/8 tsp per breast, and you can sub parsley, basil, thyme, etc.","order":5,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false}],"time":0,"order":0,"show_as_header":true,"show_ingredients_table":true}],"working_time":2,"waiting_time":20,"internal":true,"nutrition":null,"servings":4,"servings_text":"Servings","source_url":null}
