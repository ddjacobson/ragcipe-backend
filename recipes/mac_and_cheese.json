Follow the manufacturer's guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 4 minutes.\n\nAfter the pressure cook cycle is complete follow the manufacturer's guide for quick release and wait until the quick release cycle is complete. Careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid and switch to low saute setting.\n\nStir in the evaporated milk, butter and 1/4 cup water. Then add the Cheddar, a little at time, while constantly stirring, until the cheese is completely melted. Serve hot.\n\n### Notes \nWe love multi-purpose kitchen gadgets that make life easier, so that's why the Instant Pot (a slow cooker, pressure cooker and stove-top stand-in, all in one) is a go-to for quick meals. Especially this creamy kid-friendly mac and cheese, which cooks up in no time. And after it's been gobbled up, you'll only have one pot to clean!\n\n### Nutritional Information \nAmount Per: 1 Serving\nCalories: 316.89\nTotal Fat: 27.63g\nSaturated Fat: 17.57g\nCholesterol: 84.57g\nSodium: 410.64g\nPotassium: 66.38g\nTotal Carbohydrate: 0.85g\nFiber: 0g\nSugar: 0.35g\nProtein: 16.49g\n\n### Source \n \nhttps://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/5-ingredient-instant-pot-mac-and-cheese-3649854","ingredients":[{"food":{"name":"elbow macaroni","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":{"name":"lb","plural_name":null,"description":null},"amount":1.0,"note":"","order":0,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false},{"food":{"name":"Kosher salt","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":null,"amount":0.0,"note":"","order":1,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false},{"food":{"name":"One 12-ounce can evaporated milk","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":null,"amount":0.0,"note":"","order":2,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false},{"food":{"name":"unsalted butter","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":{"name":"Tbs","plural_name":null,"description":null},"amount":3.0,"note":"","order":3,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false},{"food":{"name":"shredded mild or medium Cheddar","plural_name":null,"ignore_shopping":false,"supermarket_category":null},"unit":{"name":"cups","plural_name":null,"description":null},"amount":3.0,"note":"","order":4,"is_header":false,"no_amount":false,"always_use_plural_unit":false,"always_use_plural_food":false}],"time":0,"order":0,"show_as_header":true,"show_ingredients_table":true}],"working_time":0,"waiting_time":0,"internal":true,"nutrition":null,"servings":6,"servings_text":"","source_url":null}
